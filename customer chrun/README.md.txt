# Customer Churn Analysis

## What this project is about
I looked at telecom customer data to find out who stays longer with the company, who leaves, and how much different customers spend monthly.

- Data file: WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
- Tools used: Jupyter Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## What’s included
- `Data-1.ipynb` — Notebook with all the code and charts
- Customer data CSV file

## How to use
1. Download or clone this project folder
2. Open `Data-1.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook
3. Keep the CSV data file in the same folder
4. Run all notebook cells to see the results

## Main findings
- Customers grouped by how long they stay and how much they pay
- Compared leaving rates of big spenders vs regular customers
- Focused on cleaning data and explaining in simple way
